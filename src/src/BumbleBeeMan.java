 * Make use of the three protected variables inherited from Attacker. These variables include:

 * protected ArrayList%lt;Node%gt; availableNodes - a list of the available nodes for attacking and probing.
 * protected int budget - the current budget of the Attacker. Be careful that your next move will not cost more than your budget.
